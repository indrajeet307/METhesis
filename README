Questions:
Why are we taking mean and variance ??
    Our values are discrete, it it said that we need to do the exponent, mean, variance
    thing only when data for that attribute is continuous.

[ SOLVED ]When exactly to do the log operations ? After getting the probability or before ?
    Because the values go negative( yes we can do abs() )
    heh.. To reduce the multiplication to addition ( LOL )


IMPLEMENTATION APPROACHES
[ PARTIAL ] FOR A) Generating the probability matrix
Approach 1: [ DONE ]
    #threads = #files
    each thread iterates over each opcode and contributes to the opcode of class to which
    the current file belongs
    Drawbacks: This is scatter method which is not suitable for CUDA applications
               Requires many atomic operations

[ DONE ] FOR B) Assigning the class
Approach 1: [ DONE ]
    #threads = #files
    each thread for each class calculates the summation of probability for each opcode
    assigns class with the maximum probability
    Drawbacks: Has many nested for loops, huge control divergence

TODO:
    !!!! Garbage Collection !!!
    !!!! Documentation !!!
    !!!! Refactoring !!!
    1. Grouping
        Equal number of files in each group
    2. Mean and Variance
    3. Testing and Training
        1:3 ratio
    4. Feature Selection
    6. Plot graphs for some configurations
    7. Plot graphs for memory and timing stuff
