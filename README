Questions:
Why are we taking mean and variance ??
    Our values are discrete, it it said that we need to do the exponent, mean, variance
    thing only when data for that attribute is continuous.

When exactly to do the log operations ? After getting the probability or before ?
    Because the values go negative( yes we can do abs() )
